Product Marketing: What It Is & How to Measure It
=====

The modern marketing machine is much more of a science than a skill, thanks to the science involved makes it possible to collect and analyze data in a meaningful way. At the same time, this also means we can quantitatively measure the efficiency and effectiveness of our marketing efforts.

“The kernel of a strategy contains three elements: a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and coherent action.”
― Richard Rumelt, Good Strategy/Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why It Matters 
```

```
“To be strategic is to concentrate on what is important, on those few objectives that can give us a comparative advantage, on what is important to us rather than others, and to plan and execute the resulting plan with determination and steadfastness.”

product marketing role
=====

The problem is that Product Marketing is a role that is defined somewhat differently from organization to organization. The KPIs very much define how a company thinks about product marketing.

In some organizations, especially younger ones, product marketing writes positioning statements, messaging, website copy and does sales training. Their KPIs are simply to launch products on time with a checklist of deliverables. You can demonstrate success by showing good scores on a sales training survey.

Companies who understand the role product marketing can play in the success of an organization think very differently. They make product marketing accountable for the long term growth for a product or product line. This is their KPI: product growth.

Here in this blog we are going to look into all the responsibility of a product marketer. You might have to pick the ones which are relavant to you.

Aligning everyone
=====


It should be apparent that a Product marketing Manager's should have a clear vision and logic behind why we choose the specific alternative is critical. They should be able to clearly articulate the reasoning other stakeholders get their buy in, which maximizes the business opportunities and that of others can benefit one another.



Success at product marketing requires constant risk mitigation. A product marketer’s work starts well before the product is developed. They have to understand the market, what the customer wants, and how to position the product. A product marketer may need to put on the brakes and pivot in the middle of the project.

  * How do you set marketing metrics?
    * How do you measure the impact of a product in marketing?
    * When it comes to product marketing metrics, how do you measure and communicate the success product marketing has?
  * Reasons why you need data based decision making
    * How do you approach getting approval for your roadmap from internal stakeholders?
    * How would you claim you have built a healthy pipeline of deals.
  * Why metrics and KPIs are the base of product marketing?

    * What is difference between kpi and metrics with example?
      * KPIs or Key Performance Indicators are the metrics by which you gauge business critical initiatives, objectives, or goals. The operative word in the phrase is “key,” meaning they have special or significant meaning. KPIs act as measurable benchmarks against defined goals.
       * For example, if your business goal is to increase sales by 15% over the next two quarters, the KPIs to gauge that may include, but not be limited to: new customer acquisition, customer churn, and upselling success rate. In short, a KPI can be made up of multiple metrics.

        * What are your top micro goals?
          * positioning/messaging
            * figuring out value propositions on the market, marketing channels for the audiences, and new marketing communication for the audience.
            * Spot upgrades to sales collateral while trying to drive portfolio-wide buyer research, positioning, and messaging.”

            * “Up-level content so it’s rich and compelling, understand our competitors, enable sales with value-based messaging.”
            * “This has meant rolling up sleeves and delivering on the basics: codifying our target markets, personas, value propositions, and key use cases and quickly delivering competitive battle cards and other sales enablement assets to the field.” 
          * Revenue
            * I aim to align with sales and translate the PMM efforts to the quarterly revenue.

              * Moving inbound leads to conversion: Perhaps one of the best gifts that a marketer, or a salesperson, can receive is an inbound lead that can move quickly through the sales process, ending in a deal. When this happens, especially when it happens frequently, it means that the sales process is working effectively. It also helps to ensure that return-on-investment (ROI) is where you want it to be. After all, if you get more and more inbound leads that turn into deals, especially those with a healthy average contract value, your marketing budget is bound to grow. The previous section will help you diagnose where you as a marketer can help improve the conversion rates leading to more closed deals.
          * Enablement
            * “Increase product adoption for a specific product by developing a new simple tool for merchants. Increase involvement in sales enablement battle cards creation.”
            *     “Collaborate with internal teams to provide digestible, motivating training and communications related to new features as they are released. Continuously focus on and improve alignment with the product management team to better predict and plan Go-to-Market activities.  “Build out sales enablement assets (decks, PDFs, videos) that communicate value and address the most common questions. Deepen our understanding of our personas and our persona documentation.”
          * Persona
            * “At this early stage, forming goals around competitive analysis, market research, and customer research, and baselining the client engagement lifecycle model to develop a strategic marketing plan.”
            * “My goals are to launch updated personas by X date; drive adoption of new messaging and positioning/pitch deck; deliver $XM pipeline for a newly launched product in Q1; improve attendee rating of our conference over last year.” 
        * What are your top macro goals?
          * GTM
            * “Gain the trust of stakeholders in our GTM process and assets. Clearly illustrate our total addressable market (TAM) and how we compete in each product-segment pairing. Balance the proportion of our investments in revenue-generating TAM segments and growth segments to diversify our markets, buyers, and products.  “To engage customers so that we better understand them, and increase the value we deliver, remove friction and grow their usage and adoption.” 
            * “Move upmarket, position the product as higher value at a higher price and expand into the enterprise.”
            * “Increase retention and usage, increase revenue and refine our global communication strategy.”
            * “Increased sell-through and a specific revenue goal.”

            * “Establish Celigo as a thought-leader in our market, increase ASP, accelerate land and expand the flywheel.” 
            * “Have a measurable impact on sales.”
            * “Direct revenue tie-in, product adoption, and broader marketing/company influence.” 
            * “Ensure each person on the team knows what they own and is set up for success. Build strong internal partnerships so that I can bring them along on my vision.” 
            * “Help Udemy drive revenue (by helping sales and customer success). Strategic narrative and messaging. Beat competition.”
            * “Increase product retention, increase merchants’ involvement and engagement with the product and community. Revise sales enablement structure and simplify sales processes. Unify the user journey and reduce friction.” 
            * “Create and implement new positioning to differentiate us, full localization of all content in our top markets, define TAM, and create a new website.” 
            * “A seat at the table a bit earlier in the roadmap process; full transparency between product and product marketing, improved collaboration between the rest of the marketing function, and continuing to grow trust with sales teams in the field by providing true value.” 
            * “Growth! Maturing and streamlining our go-to-market strategy and rallying sales, channel, marketing, product, and other teams around it. Moving from a product to a portfolio marketing strategy.
            * “Develop a best-in-class marketing function and build a healthy pipeline of deals.” 
            * “Maturing cross-departmental operations related to new product introduction and injecting more experimentation and measurement within the marketing team.” 
        * How do you measure product success in marketing?
          * At a high level, product marketing’s main areas of focus include go-to-market initiatives, sales enablement, marketing support, and product adoption.

      * https://skale.so/demand-gen/metrics/
        * Marketing Qualified Leads: MQLs 
        * ------
        * A market qualified lead is someone who you deem as very likely to convert into a sale. It is not someone ready to buy there and then, but someone aware of your brand and solution, needs it, and is willing to learn more about it. An MQL is someone that will welcome more marketing/nurturing. 
        * Of course, people don’t turn around and say to you: “Hey, I’m an MQL!” if only things were that easy. This means you’ll need a certain amount of lead intelligence to determine a Marketing Qualified Leads. These factors are informed by closed-loop analytics. This can be anything from: 
          * clicks on key pages on your website (like the sales and product pages) 
          * time spent on site
          * XX amount of site visits within a period 
          * signing up for your newsletter or other low-barrier signup content
          * downloading a whitepaper or guide
          * attending a webinar 
        * All of these actions indicate someone is happy to engage with your business, needs your solution, but for whatever reason needs more marketing material to buy. 
        * Sales Qualified Lead (SQLs) & Sales Accepted Lead (SALs)
        * ------
        * Sales qualified leads (SQLs) and sales accepted leads (SALs) are two essential demand gen metrics that will indicate if your demand gen strategy is performing well or not. 
        * An SQL is someone your sales team has qualified to receive sales material and buy your product. They are often referred to as a ‘hot’ lead and, like an MQL, will need data intelligence (that you decide upon) to determine they’re ready to be sold to or not. 
        * These determining factors come from past sales if you’ve never aligned on this before. A few things to consider are: 
          * frequent visits to the pricing page
          * contacting sales 
          * trialing a freemium version of your product 
          * having items in their cart/basket
          * undergone the checkout process but dropped off 
          * certain keywords mentioned with your chatbot
        * Similar to an SQL is a SAL—a sales accepted lead. The difference between these two things is how hands-on your marketing and sales teams are, who is leading who, and how much technology you can access. 
        * Whereas digital actions can determine an SQL, a SAL refers to the lead being accepted by sales manually. This is typically done at a more qualitative level. For example, a salesperson may have a call with someone and deem them “acceptable” to be sold to, need nurturing (an MQL), or be unqualified—for numerous reasons. 
        * Both of these metrics are fantastic in identifying demand for your product.
        * Cost per Acquisition, CAC
        * ------
        * Your cost per acquisition is a fantastic insight into the success of your demand gen strategy. Although following demand generation best practices doesn’t necessarily mean sales, the number of customers acquired and how much those sales cost you are attributed to your demand gen strategies. 
        * Note: this metric is different from your cost per lead (CPL).  Your cost per lead looks at people that could potentially buy, however, customer acquisition costs looks at those who do buy.
        * For example, if you make ten sales and a profit of $9 per month per sale, but your customers are only staying with you for one month, and you spent $100 per customer on marketing strategies and costs, you’re not working towards a sustainable and profitable business. 
        * By keeping an eye on your cost per acquisition, you keep an eye on how much each customer costs you. Consider what your spend to acquire customers is and their ROI: customer lifetime value (CLTV). 
        * By measuring customer acquisition costs, it’s an indicator of the demand you have—or have not—managed to generate for your SaaS.
        * Activations & Signups
        * ------
        * Two key metrics that come hand-in-hand when measuring demand generation are your activations and your signups. 
        * How many people are signing up for your product? This doesn’t need to be a paid sign-up; it can also be a freemium version of your SaaS that you’re running. At the same time, how many people are activating within your product, meaning, how many people are becoming active users? 
        * Both of these demand gen metrics let you know your SaaS marketing team and lead generation campaign is doing are doing a great job at the top of the funnel, building knowledgeable demand for your SaaS and business. 
        * Customer Lifetime Value CLTV
        * ------
        * Customer lifetime value, CLTV, sometimes shortened to LTV, is a great demand generation metric to track. It’s referring to the average customer lifetime value, no individual cases. By seeing an increase in your customer lifetime value, you know that your demand generation is going the extra mile. What do we mean here? There’s a difference between generating demand for your SaaS and generating educated demand. 
        * When it comes to customer lifetime value, there’s absolutely no point in generating demand for your business if this demand will not convert—either into sales or referrals. If you’re generating demand but are not seeing an increase in customer lifetime value or some of the other metrics we’ve mentioned above, then your efforts are in vain. 
        * Customer lifetime value is an important reminder that you can’t just be shooting for demand for the sake of hitting vanity metrics. If your demand is not going to stick around, then it’s time to reassess what you’re doing up front. 
        * Payback period
        * ------
        * This is a really important metric to track to ensure your upfront costs and marketing efforts are paying your business back further down the line. 
        * For example, if your demand gen costs are still keeping your business profitable, or at the minimum, keeping your numbers in the green when you’re just looking for user growth. 
        * Your payback period is how long it takes to win back your upfront costs of winning a paid user. For a healthy SaaS, this should be 12 months or less. You can calculate your payback period using the following equation: 
        * CAC / ARPA = Payback Period 
        * Psst! Your ARPA = your average revenue per account per month. Some people say this is your annual revenue per account, but we’re keeping it as average revenue per account on a monthly basis, for what we’ve mentioned above.
        * Days in status
        * ------
        * An absolute must for Ian Marck, Head of Growth at EasyMovie, is the days a lead stays on a given status before moving to the next one. In short, days in status—each section is part of a greater metric: marketing cycle length (MCL). Days in status can refer to any stage in the sales funnel; it could be MQL to SQL or directly MQL to customer.
        * “While this indicator is normally considered for RevOps or Sales, I can divide my acquisition cost per day on a given status. CAC is a nice indicator but rather on the end-tail of the typical process. 
        * What I am looking at is to shed some light on how the budget is impacting the pipeline. Not just in plain number of leads, but also in velocity or the duration of a phase. Where exactly in my pipeline are demand gen efforts are contributing?”
        * A good demand gen strategy alongside a sleek sales machine and RevOps strategy should see your days in status either reducing or being at a rate the provides your business value while not losing time. 
        * It’s a delicate balance of efficiency and speed—not rushing someone through a process they’re not ready for.
        * Marketing sourced pipeline
        * ------
        * This metric is also referred to as the ‘close rate’ per channel. Andy Davis, Director of demand gen at Attest, shared his view on this all-important demand gen metric. 
        * “Marketing sourced pipeline and revenue are critical success measures for demand gen. They are what demand or revenue-generating teams are there to do. 
        * Even with a fairly quick SaaS sales cycle, you likely still have a 30-60 day sales cycle. Demo requests on your website are an excellent leading metric to track. This is a very clear measure of creating increased demand in the market. 
        * An increase in demo requests is an increase in the people with sales intent who are actively seeking you out.”
        * With this in mind, keep an eye on where your best demand gen sources are. What are they costing your business? What’s the return of investment for each? If you can identify demand gen avenues that are working well for your SaaS, then consider if it’s worth investing more in that particular channel—be it time, money, or something else. 
        * 
        * Average deal size 
        * ------
        * Within your demand gen strategy, you’re likely to have numerous tactics to build demand among your ICPs. For this reason, a core metric to track for your demand gen progress is the average deal size you’re winning from each tactic. 
        * When you can attribute a channel to the largest deals, rather than simply the most deals, you can start making smarter decisions about where to place your time and money. 
        * For example, you could find a customer from SEO efforts is 4x more likely to sign a larger contract than five customers from PPC. Yet, you spend the same amount of time on each channel—for now. 
        * Measure your average deal size and from which channel, and you’ll make smarter lead generation decisions in the future. 
        * SEO ROI for SaaS
        * Contribution to total revenue
        * ------
        * Once you’ve got the above demand gen KPIs locked down, you can start looking at the bigger picture. How much revenue is your demand gen bringing your SaaS business in comparison to other revenue generation strategies?
        * For example, compare the amount of revenue your demand gen has brought to your upselling or cross-selling strategies to current customers. Are you generating more revenue? Are you generating less? What’s really making a profit for your SaaS, and what are you spending money on because you think you should be?
        * Content performance 
        * ------
        * There’s a high chance you’ll be using plenty of different content types to build and maintain your demand gen strategy. Whether you’re using video, blogs, illustrations, great storytelling, infographics, or something else, there are quantitative ways for you to measure the success of your content depending on how you’re distributing it.
        * For example, social media can tell you a lot about your content is being received with comments, likes, shares, saves, and post or link clicks insights. Various email management tools can also let you know if your subject lines are punchy enough to get an open or your in-email content is earning clicks. 
        * Find SaaS tools that will give your quantitative feedback on the effectiveness of your content and work with the data you have. There’s always room to optimize your demand gen strategy.
        * Brand sentiment 
        * ------
        * Last but certainly not least for demand gen metrics to track is your brand sentiment. If you’re delivering branded content well at the top of funnel, you should start to see your brand sentiment lift over time. 
        * Like with content performance tracking, there are a few SaaS tools out there to empower you to get the feedback you need. 
        * Platforms like Typeform and VideoAsk are great for customer feedback, or you can try a user research platform like Maze to test your brand sentiment against your target demographic. 
        * However, you chose to compose your brand sentiment research; the important thing is that you’re doing it, learning from it, and constantly tweaking your content upfront to build better relationships with future customers.

        * There are two ways to categorize product development metrics:
          * Strategic or tactical: Strategic metrics measure the overall production on a long timeline, such as the number of patents filed over several years. Tactical metrics gauge shorter term productivity or individual output, such as the number of software bugs per release or lines of code per developer.
          * Input or output: Input metrics measure the resources that are fed into product development organization such as additional headcount and research and development (R&D) budget. Output metrics measure what’s produced, such as the number of products released
        * Selecting the right product development metrics is essential. Companies have access to a vast array of digital information and the more judicious they are about limiting their focus to the few product KPIs that matter, the more control they have to achieve the right outcomes. Like a vehicle with too many controls on its dashboard, teams with too many metrics sometimes have trouble remembering which button does what. If those metrics aren’t tied to an outcome that matters, such as generating revenue, they might only serve as an unhelpful distraction. Here are a few criteria for selecting metrics:
          * Limit the number of metrics
          * Keep the metrics simple
          * Avoid metrics that would be impractical to collect
          * Prioritize metrics that have a direct revenue impact
      * 10 product development metrics. Strategic product development metrics:
        * Research and development (R&D) as a percentage of sales
        * Total R&D / product headcount
        * New product sales
        * New patent generation 
        * New products released
        * Average product ROI
      * https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/taking-the-measure-of-product-development
        * [QUOTE] In our analysis, we considered a company to be “using” a metric if it was cited by more than one-third of staff interviewed. That’s important, because widespread knowledge of a metric indicates that the company is using that indicator actively as part of its performance-management processes.
      * https://www.appcues.com/blog/product-led-growth-metrics
        * Time to value
          * Time to value (TTV) is the amount of time it takes new users to realize your product’s value. Your goal should be to reduce time to value as much as possible—the sooner users reach their first aha moment or activation event, the better. To do this, focus on optimizing your user onboarding experience around the key actions within your product that correlate to activation, like inviting colleagues to your platform, importing customer data, or integrating with other tools in their tech stack. If you need help defining the key actions that lead users to activation, our aha moment guide has the answers you need. TTV can also be defined as the time it takes a user to move from the activation to adoption phase in the Product-Led Growth Flywheel framework.
        * Product-qualified leads
          * Product-qualified leads (PQLs) are typically activated users. These are users who have completed a key action within your product, had their aha moment, and experienced your product’s value for themselves.
          * To define what a product-qualified lead looks like for your product, you’ll need to identify your product’s activation event and the actions that users take within your product that indicate they are ready to move on to the next stage in their journey. You can do this through a combination of user interviews, session recordings, and A/B tests to identify the user behaviors that correlate with conversion and retention.
          * In the Product-Led Growth Flywheel framework, time to value is associated with the activation stage of the user journey.
        * Feature adoption rate
          * Product management teams typically have the product adoption rate high on their list of KPIs to track when launching a new product. But you’re missing a major piece of the PLG puzzle if you fail to add the feature adoption rate to that list as well.
          * Both rates are key metrics that indicate how well your product is received by your target users. The product adoption rate tells you the percentage of active users, while the feature adoption rate (which is also measured as a percentage) clues you into why people continue to engage with your product. You may find that the adoption rate of a new feature is what’s driving your overall product adoption rate to climb.
          * Getting insight into which features users find the most value in will inform your product positioning and any other product decisions you make.  
        * Expansion revenue
          * It’s a lot easier to get more money from happy, paying customers than it is to acquire new ones. It’s more cost-effective, too—it’s roughly 2X cheaper to upsell to an existing customer than to acquire a new one, and over 3X cheaper to generate expansion revenue than the customer acquisition cost (CAC) of a new customer.
          * That’s why expansion revenue is easily one of the most important levers for sustainable SaaS growth. Also called expansion monthly recurring revenue (MRR), this metric measures the revenue generated from existing customers through upsells, add-ons, and cross-sells. For a healthy SaaS business, ProfitWell recommends that at least 30% of your revenue should be expansion revenue.
          * In the Product-Led Growth Flywheel framework, expansion revenue is associated with the adoration stage of the user journey, when your regular users are looking for new ways to use your product.
        * Average revenue per user
          * The average revenue per user (ARPU) is the amount of money, on average, that you can expect to make from an individual user. ARPU is a good, high-level indicator of business health and is often used by analysts to compare SaaS companies.
          * ARPU is a straightforward metric, calculated as total MRR divided by total number of users.
          * Using the different sections of the Product-Led Growth Flywheel, you can segment your user groups and find out the ARPU for each group. It might seem obvious that the evaluator group has a lower ARPU than your beginners. But you may be surprised to learn that the ARPU for your regulars is higher than your champions. Or maybe the ARPU of your beginners is higher than you originally predicted. The Flywheel is a great way to unlock user engagement insights like ARPU.
        * Customer lifetime value
          * Customer lifetime value (CLV or LTV) predicts the amount of revenue your business will receive from a single customer over the lifetime of their account. Lifetime value is used to identify valuable customer segments—all of which are defined in the Product-Led Growth Flywheel—and gain a more thorough understanding of reasonable acquisition and retention costs.
          * There are many ways to calculate CLV, both historically and predictively. However you do the math, customer lifetime value is one of the most important SaaS metrics you can measure. It allows you to not only understand how much a customer is worth to you right now, but also to predict how valuable they will be to your business over time.
        * Net revenue churn
          * Some people are going to leave your product, plain and simple. Unfortunately, you’re almost always going to have to report some churn. When you do, net churn is a more useful metric for SaaS business than gross churn rate, because it gives you a more holistic picture of your company’s health.
          * Generally speaking, revenue churn is a more useful metric for SaaS growth than customer churn. Because, let’s be real; even though it sucks to lose your favorite customer, losing your most profitable customer hurts even more.
          * That’s why, if you only report one churn number, it should be net revenue churn—the amount of money lost after accounting for new, expansion, or reactivated revenue.
        * Net revenue retention
          * You may already keep track of your overall retention rate, but it’s important to also consider the number of customers you’ve retained and how much each of them is spending. After all, not every customer uses your product in the same way. Some retained customers may have upgraded and adopted new paid features or services. Other existing customers may have downgraded their plans or reverted to the free version of your app (if you have a SaaS product that’s on a freemium pricing structure).
          * Similar to net revenue churn, your net revenue retention rate tells you how much revenue you’ve generated after taking into account your expansion revenue as well as your churn rate.
          * Churn and retention are concerns at every stage of the user journey, as visualized in the Product-Led Growth Flywheel, but are especially relevant for regular users who have adopted your product but have yet to adore it. Knowing how much revenue you’re generating from retained customers shows you how effective your upsell and cross-sells marketing efforts are, and can uncover any weaknesses in your product that cause users to downgrade their subscriptions. 
        * Customer satisfaction score (CSAT)
          * For your product to drive your company’s growth, you need to ensure your users are satisfied with your product. You might not be able to assign a numerical value to a person’s overall happiness, but when it comes to gauging how much your average customer likes your product, there’s a metric for that—CSAT.
          * Measuring customer satisfaction (CSAT) requires hearing directly from your users, so the feedback is especially valuable during product development. Build analytical feedback into your product with an in-app survey, so users can submit their opinions of your product as they engage with it.
          * Conducting live user interviews is also valuable for in-depth feedback. Keep in mind though, calculating your CSAT only requires users to rate their experience with your product on a short scale, usually between one and five, where 1 equals extremely dissatisfied and 5 equals extremely satisfied.  
          * Like all other product metrics, your CSAT score will vary over time. The longer someone uses a product, the more time they have to either find more value in it or discover its challenges, so be sure to measure CSAT regularly. Present in-app user surveys at regular intervals (once a month is a good frequency) to stay on top of which direction customer satisfaction is trending. Whether your CSAT score increases or drops, remember to collect more in-depth customer feedback to supplement and enrich the data you have. It’s good to know how satisfied customers are with your product, but it’s more important to know why they feel that way.
        * Virality
          * The terms virality and network effects are sometimes used interchangeably but are, in fact, very different (although they often occur hand in hand). We’ll discuss network effects in the next section, but let’s first bring attention to how virality helps you better understand the user experience.  
          * Product virality occurs when a product’s rate of adoption increases exponentially with each additional user. For viral growth to happen, users must be able to promote your product by using it. If you notice that your virality is increasing, it’s a good indicator that your existing users are satisfied with your product and are likely championing your product within their networks.
          * Take Zoom, for example. By sending a Zoom video conference link to attendees who don’t already use the tool, existing users promote the product in the context of its use.
        * Network effects
          * A product with a network effect, on the other hand, becomes more valuable to users as more people adopt the product.
          * Think of an app like Instagram or a two-sided marketplace like Airbnb: The more people post photos on a regular basis or list their homes for rent, the better the product experience becomes for other users in the long run.
          * Both virality and network effects are closely associated with the advocacy stage of the Product-Led Growth Flywheel. By inviting other users to evaluate and adopt your product, your customers help increase new acquisition.

    * Why Digital Marketing Managers Should Be Obsessed With Data Analysis
      * Product Marketers must develop a data driven system that will help them Drive customer engagement, customer loyalty, and advocacy. Differentiate themselves from the competition by better recognizing what works and what does not.
      * Product marketing managers and a data-driven approach are tied dynamically with a premise founded on confirmed evidence. Most want their direction based on a careful assessment of facts that are underscored by experiments built with frequently repeated tests. These tests give us insight into which choice is best and which option doesn't with research for every potential outcome.

      * A PMM analyze  unstructured data to find patterns and correlations. definitely worth it if you want to find valuable insights. What has we lost by limiting the data we rely on to conform with unpopular assumptions? A data-obsessed society unearths insightful new discoveries by scrutinizing all the information they have. Nevertheless, they re also prone to disregarding upworthy hypotheses when they lack relevant support data.

      * Which marketing channel gains the most adoption and popularity with customers? Which promotional offer is most popular among customers? Which value proposition do they cherish most? These decisions have massive downstream ramifications, including resource allocation, budgeting, go-to-market strategies, market competitiveness, and so on.

      * It's prudent to have a desire to seek supporting data for these choices and the opportunity to make data-backed judgments on the spot. But even a skilled suspect can fall apart at the knees when hastily making decisions. Nonetheless, these decisions tend to eliminate a fantastic start-up idea long before it has found its feet.
