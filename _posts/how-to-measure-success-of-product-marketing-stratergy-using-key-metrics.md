How to measure the effectiveness of your product marketing strategy
=====

Modern product marketing is more of a science than a skill, thanks to all the Metrics available today. Metrics make it possible to collect and analyze data in a meaningful way. As a result, today, we can quantitatively measure the efficiency and effectiveness of our product marketing efforts.

The Role of Product Marketing in Organizational Success?
=====

The role of Product Marketing is defined somewhat differently from organization to organization. Consequently, the KPIs that go into making decisions about Product Marketing change.

In some organizations, especially younger ones, product marketing does research, writes positioning statements, messaging, website content, product launches, and sales training. Some enterprises will put people or teams on paper for these items.

Business executives who understand the importance of product marketing for an organization’s overall profitability view it as a central component of business operations. Therefore, they utilize product marketing to develop the business’s overall strategy to continue fostering its product line for the long term.

A product marketing specialist is also responsible for gaining the trust of company executives by demonstrating that they provide value. To build and maintain trust, build a reliable cohesive plan based on verifiable metrics.

This blog will explore all the metrics product marketers need to know and how to track and improve their performance to succeed. You might have to pick the ones which are relevant to you. Ensure these key indicators pertain to each stakeholder and are available in a dashboard. It’s crucial, that these items must be accessible to the business leaders as well.


<!-- 
```
In our analysis, we considered a company to be “using” a metric if it was cited by more than one-third of staff interviewed. That’s important, because widespread knowledge of a metric indicates that the company is using that indicator actively as part of its performance-management processes.

!["Dashboard and its usage in Product Marketing"](/assets/images/metrics/dashboard.png "Dashboard and its usage in Product Marketing")

The key areas of target metrics will pertain to responsibilities around Marketing, product management, sales enablement and customer success. Product marketing usually does not own any of these departments and hence should have to operate though influence and not authority.

Practical tips for reducing the  Disconnect Between you and the rest of the stake holders in your organization. you are the one person who has a well-rounded view of the company, and input on the strategic direction of the product roadmap, position, message, and company.

Understanding the internal stake holder needs, claim your position as 
More clearly identified roles and responsibilities of what we own vs what product and sales enablement and marketing own. Being recognized more for their strategic capabilities, and not just tactical product launches.

It should be apparent that a Product marketing Manager's should have a clear vision and logic behind why we choose the specific alternative is critical. They should be able to clearly articulate the reasoning other stakeholders get their buy in, which maximizes the business opportunities and that of others can benefit one another.

Success at product marketing requires constant risk mitigation. A product marketer’s work starts well before the product is developed. They have to understand the market, what the customer wants, and how to position the product. A product marketer may need to put on the brakes and pivot in the middle of the project.

The key areas of traget metrics will pertain to responsibilities around Marketing, product management, sales enablement and customer success.

Practical tips for defining your role as a product marketer in your organization. 

Some of the metrics below may not be of use in your organization, so use it based on judgement. Also make sure you talk with the respecitive stake holder(if it is not you) who will be working on these metrics to see if it is valid and if they agree to it.

Here are some examples of how you can use these metrics
====

* Back you with prioritizing a specific feature with product management
* Getting approval for your roadmap from internal stakeholders?
* Help you identify which part of your funnel is leaking and if the messaging will fix this leak.
* Decide if a strategy will work based on your collected experimental data.
* claim you have built a healthy pipeline of deals.


KPI Vs metrics with example?
====

KPIs(Key performance indicators) are a way to measure and track the performance of an initiative in the organization. They typically involve multiple metrics to ensure clarity, so businesses need to have clear goals when using this tool!

Here is an example KPI:
* Increase revenue by 15% by the end of the year. For this, below are the metrics that will have to be measured.
  * Increased MQL by 35%
  * Increased conversion to SQL by 25%
  * Increased retention by 20%

Metrics grouped based on roles or responsibilities 
=====

(SEM)marketing metrics to measure success (SAAS)
-----
* How do you measure prodcut marketing impact in marketing?
  * It ultimately boils down to these metrics MQL/PQL/SQL or TOFL/MOFL/BOFL which every way you would like to call it.
  * How to measure
      * Website traffic: google analytics, Hotjar, so on
      * Social media: Every social media has its insights, but it would be optimal to use tools like [buffer.com], [sproutsocial.com], [Zoho Social](https://www.zoho.com/social/) all you to track insights like followers, engagement rate, so on.
  * What to analyse
    * Is the positioning working as expected ?
    * Is the messaging provides a healthy conversion from MQL to SQL
<!--   * MQL
    * Leads at the first touch point can show interest in a solution like yours by browsing your website, listening to podcasts, following walls of your company's social media page, participating in webinars, downloading a whitepaper or guide, looking for specific keywords online, and subscribing to newsletters. Marketing qualified leads (or MQLs)  actively engage with your business and look like a potential match.
    * What to measure
      * If your positioning works well only if the MQL converstion to SQL is at optimal level.
    * How to measure
      * Website traffic: google analytics, Hotjar, so on
      * Social media: Every social media has its insights, but it would be optimal to use tools like [buffer.com], [sproutsocial.com], [Zoho Social](https://www.zoho.com/social/) all you to track insights like followers, engagement rate, so on.

  * SQL
    * A lead with a high potential of turning into a customer is considered a sales-qualified lead (SQL). A SQL has shown intent to purchase and has fulfilled requirements used to determine that they are a good match for a particular product or service. The lead criteria may vary based on your company's size and offerings, but generally, a SQL is a mature lead in your pipeline. -->

* How do you measure the impact in sales?
  * Incase of sales it is the revenue which gives a clear picture
  * How to measure
    * Win/loss ratio 
    * Internal Survey with sales to understand how the enablement assets perform in the real world.
  * What to analyse
    * Are the pitch decks helping sales ?
    * is the ideal client profile matching with the newly added clients  ?


    <!-- * Pipeline and bookings
    * GTM efficacy
    * Sales Confidence - Pulse survey 1 per quarter (How confident are you competing against competitor x, y, z (scale of 1 - 5), how impactful is our competitive content and training (scale 1 - 5).... questions like that which gives us a baseline to match up against our OKRs) 
    * GTM efficacy - This is rooted in the fact that its the job of the PMMs to align the GTM teams on launches and GTM strategy/execution, therefore we also take a survey pulse of how well the launch team felt aligned and prepared (again scale of 1 - 5).  I'm also exploring product-market fit although many of our solutions are a bit more mature that compete in more mature markets so the jury is still out as to whether that is a good enough measurement for GTM efficacy.
    * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk9bKRdtqPg
    * Know ideal client profile for new solution.
    * Win/loss rate is a fave of our revenue
    * PMM : Sales
    Key deliverables: Pitch decks, enablement assets (internal resources like battlecards and personas, external resources like one-pagers and case studies), and trainings 
    Key goals: Improve win rates, improve competitive win rates, increase ASP, shorten sales cycles, improve demo request to demo held rates, generate pipeline, improve sales team confidence 

    pre-sales customer journey and business goals, such as use cases, pitch decks, customer case studies, and other prospect facing content.

    how PMM can influence closed/won rate - deal velocity - pipe gen - upsell/expansion and AVC. Deliverables: pitch decks, one-pagers, enablement content, demo overview videos, snippets, outreach templates, case studies, eBooks/playbooks, persona guides

    For leading, do your campaign metrics indicate that people are interested and engaged? How is this helping you fill your funnel? Can you use technology like Gong, which records and transcribes sales conversations, to track keywords associated with the launch? Was there a spike in keyword use post campaign? And were mentions in a positive context?

    For lagging, what did win/loss reveal? Was the product/feature instrumental in their decision? How did they find out about it?

    * PMM : CS
        Key deliverables: Same as sales, but with an existing customer upgrade / health / cross-sell / retention angle. Add in enablement on new features and important changes (like pricing), and resources like maturity models or crawl/walk/run decks. 
        Key goals: Average customer health score, net retention or churn rates, NPS, CS-driven expansion, lifetime value [though be careful about signing up for these, as seen in one of my other answers!]

    such as detailed use cases, QBR decks (quarterly business review), roadmap decks, and other customer facing content.

    net retention, NPS, engagement and utilization. Deliverables: knowledgebase articles, snippets/outreach templates, messaging guidance, overview videos, product tours, one-pagers, eBooks/playbooks, case studies, events/webinars

    * PMM : Marketing

        Key deliverables: Messaging and positioning, launch moments and/or campaigns, website pages, case studies, personas and customer insights, demo and/or explainer videos, competitive intelligence, and more
        Key goals: Website traffic, share of voice, engagement metrics for external moments like launches or campaigns, website conversion rate / bounce rate, and (whenever possible) revenue-focused metrics like leads/demo requests, MQLs, opportunities/pipeline, and self-serve ARR

     Drive pipeline and bookings by supporting strategic marketing plans (demand gen campaigns, paid media, growth experiments) that build brand/product awareness and interest.

     We measure success by PQLs generated, funnel conversion and overarching project execution. Deliverables for marketing mostly consist of launch plans, positioning + messaging docs, product overviews, videos, scripts, outlines, case studies, reviews, webinars, newsletters, slide decks. etc.

    * PMM : Product

        Key deliverables: Product positioning, roadmap feedback, market/customer research, competitive intelligence, launches, GTM strategy for new products, support with onboarding experiences and product-led growth/virality
        Key goals: Feature adoption, adoption and/or revenue generated from new product lines, self-serve revenue, NPS, net retention rate, specific virality metrics

        with PMs as product/features advance throughout roadmap. Goals: attach rate, WAUs/MAUs, utiliaztion, use case activation. Deliverables - executing launch plans and meeting attach goals, case studies, messaging + positioning, 


    *    Personas - How well are the personas defined and how well does the marketing and sales org understand these personas? What research has been conducted? Which documents can we point to?
    Messaging - Good messaging is highly subjective but the key here is ensuring all messaging has been vetted by sales, customers, and internal experts. Is the messaging easily consumed by other stakeholders like content marketers?
    Sales enablement - If you’re B2B, PMMs are directly responsible for enabling the field on the market, competition, product positioning, messaging, pitches, and demos. Of course, this is all influenced pipeline but is the foundation there? If it’s not, you’ve got work to do.
    Campaign strategy - PMMs should be shaping and directing the themes of campaigns throughout the year and educating the marketing org on why a certain kind of campaign is needed. Campaign runners are responsible for driving those campaigns in market.
    Product launches - PMMs are often the quarterback for launches. How many launches can be accomplished per year? How organized are these launches? Are they reaching their target audience? Was the launch able to drive the expected amount of product adoption?
    Analyst briefings & thought leadership - Just keeping analysts informed and up-to-date is critically important for the business. Spearheading a Gartner MQ is a ton of work. Did you develop thought leadership themes with the comms team?
    Events - Supporting user conferences, tradeshows, and keynotes. How many field events did you support?
    * How should product marketing split feature adoption KPIs with the product team (for B2B self-serve SaaS)
      * In an ideal world product and product marketing should be embedded in one another’s efforts from start to finish (see my other response on “customer needs” and getting PMM further upstream). In this world product marketing has played an active role in helping set the vision for the feature, doing research to support its validation/market opportunity, and coordinating the launch priority (e.g. is this a “nice to have” vs. a tentpole launch). In such a scenario it can often be appropriate for product and product marketing to sign up for shared KPI targets on things like free trials, signups, active engagement in first 30 days, 3-month retention, etc.

      * However, many teams are still working toward that ideal world. If the product team only involves the product marketing team at the very end of the product development process as “the team I go to when my feature is ready to launch” then it might make more sense for the product team to own much more of the adoption KPIs. Why? Because in this scenario PMMs have very little latitude with the tools at their disposal like messaging and launch tactics since many of the core decisions around the value prop and target audience — which ultimately play a huge role in product/market fit and therefore adoption — have already been made.
      * 
      * So I am actually not sure this should be split, the best companies I have ever worked at Product Management and Product Marketing shared these numbers and it was our goal as a team to impact these. Now not every company looks at it this way, some just want to know the impact YOU as a single person or team are impacting. So I usually talk about owning registration numbers, second week retention numbers and have the product teams focused on the MAU and DAU numbers from there out and work with them to make sure they are retaining. 
      * 
      * Why split? Make feature adoption a shared metric between PMM and PM teams. This is an important metric for both teams. I would use this metric pre-launch to really understand the target market segment, to set the baseline, and to define post-launch target. Post-launch, evaluate how the needle moves on this metric. If you are doing this in your company for the first time, this could start interesting conversations. Depending on the root cause analysis, PM and PMM will own different metrics to move the adoption up. 
      *    Example: Customers don't use this feature as anticipated because it adds several extra steps to their workflow: This is a great PM, UX conversation
    We see low adoption because our target users don't find value in the feature: As a PMM, you should think about whether you crafted a good target market segment for the launch. Pivot your GTM strategy and communicate to the new segment if your initial assumption was wrong. 
    We see low adoption because customers were did not get any communication and the discoverability of the feature was hard: PMM, PM, Design, Demand Gen, Customer Marketing - they all need to discuss this. 
    ... so on.. you get my point.
      * 
      * To the contrary, I always like to share and align on KPIs with the product team. Bonus points is you can also align that with key partners in other functions as well, like growth marketing. The more you can stay aligned from the top, the more naturally everything else will fall when it comes to prioritization and resourcing of projects.
      * Now, some KPIs will vary widely based on the lifecycle of the product and the context of your company. Here are some examples to get your wheels turning:
      * For new products: Adoption (X% of users are using a product) and monthly/daily active users of the product
      * For products later in their lifecycle: Activation % (how many new users become activated users), Virality (if your product can be shared, is it being shared and how often)
      * 
      * The ideal scenario is that product and product marketing have shared adoption KPIs because this creates greater investment and accountability from both groups. If that’s not the case, product will tend to focus on post-login KPIs such as MAUs and DAUs. Marketing will focus on pre-login KPIs such as site visits, email engagement rates etc. Overall, it’s best if both teams focus on the NPS as that’s a clear indicator of how satisfied customers are with the product and if they will recommend it to others.
      * 
      * First off, is feature adoption the right KPI? In my opinion, focusing on feature adoption could be too narrow of a metric and doesn't shed light on what the end-user is experiencing. End users don't find value in features; they find value in getting their job to be done, done, and more effectively or efficiently than they did it before.
      * At a basic level, product is responsible for building a feature that solves a job to be done effectively and efficiently. Product marketing is responsible for ensuring the value of the job to be done is described clearly and compellingly to the right audience or segment of customers or users. There are ways to measure these two things separately if you need to. 
      * After a feature launch, look at the feature adoption funnel just as you would a product adoption funnel. Where do you have drop-off? If the reach of your feature launch was significant, but very few tried the feature, you likely have a messaging or segmentation problem. Did you target the right audience? Was your message clear and compelling? If your engagement in the feature spiked at launch but the continued use was low, your audience is likely not finding value in the feature.
      * 
      * PMMs should be responsible for KPIs that bring users and customers to the product and through onboarding and activation. Are the materials provided to educate a user leading to activation? Is the onboarding experience good? Are experiments leading to intended results? Once the user has activated, PMs should be responsible for owning long-term adoption of specific feature areas. At some point, sending more emails to remind users that certain features exist just won't cut it. If the feature isn't solving a real business problem, that's a problem with the product.
      * 
      * In any SaaS business, “adoption” is a company-wide priority. If customers aren’t happy and using the product, you’re just putting your sales/marketing investments into a leaky bucket. So it makes sense that Marketing -- and PMM specifically -- would monitor adoption closely, and even set KPIs in this area. While I see Product as primarily responsible for tracking the usability of the features they build in a detailed way (i.e. did moving the button make a difference/did a given change resolve broken user flows) PMM should be looking at the big picture of feature usage, and advancing adoption of the functionality that leads to success and expansion.

      * Ultimately, the division of labor between Product and PMM is nuanced, and a lot depends on the Product/PMM relationship (for example, I’ve worked in companies where PMM has very little say in roadmap prioritization, and companies where PMM insights drive everything.) At a minimum, PMM should set KPIs to measure the adoption of “value ad” features that guide upsell/ justify packaging and pricing decisions, and ensure that product usage data is being leveraged for better outcomes company-wide.

      * For example, in my last role, we identified that customers who adopted three core pieces of functionality were more successful using the product in the first 30 days, and were significantly less likely to churn within the year. So PMM focused on making sure that the right onboarding emails and support practices were in place across marketing and CS to guide customers to those pieces of functionality. We also leveraged in-product tutorial tools (like Pendo) to help customers get started in-app, and passed data from our tests to Product, so things that worked could be hardcoded into the product experience. Looking at success wasn’t just about the feature usage stats themselves, it was about measuring holistically the impact of our efforts across all of these teams, and helping the company understand/improve what drove adoption for all of our users.

      * I think the other area PMM can focus on is promoted features (features launched based on win/loss data, differentiating features, upsell features.) PMM should always be monitoring whether these releases are being highlighted appropriately, and if campaigns result in significant uptick in usage and acquisition numbers. 

      * Hey y'all, I am doing research on seven different industries that our company is trying to sell into. Does anyone have a suggested template or framework that would be best to organize my findings to present to the exec board?
      * Dave Prager: We came up with a good framework for scoring verticals for prioritization. We scored the following attributes:
      * Prioritization Formula = Market Size (40%) + Win Rates (30%) + ASP (20%) + Field Opinions (10%)
        * Market Size = TAM * % knowledge workers * % FTE segment
        * Win Rates = Closed Won / (Closed Won + Closed Loss)
        * ASP = Sum of Booking ARR / Count of Closed Won
      * Field Opinion Score = Avg. priority rating on a scale of 1-10 (edited) 
      * If you don't have historical win rates and ASP, you should project it

      * Partners
        * hey, we're looking at working with one of our strategic partners to put together some "better together" messaging / collateral that calls out the added value of using our products in tandem. i'd love to hear anyone's experiences of doing this, what worked, and what you now know that you wish you knew at the time. thanks!
        * Make sure you understand what winning looks like for them!
          * Pageviews?
          * Daily Active Users?
          * Expected Pipeline Value?
          * Bookings?

        * 1 - In addition to collateral, you might consider a demo and/or slides for both sales teams that illustrate the power of integrated experience and associated benefits.  Even better - a joint account for live demos.
        * 2- Find customer (s) that have both resources. Demo and discuss the integrated capabilities. Get quotes  about the features/benefits and the jobs they'll get done with integrated solutions in their own words. Often they'll articulate the value in a way that really resonates for customers like them.
        * 3-Consider partnering on a booth announcement at tradeshows that both companies attend
        * 4 - Discuss branding considerations and review process/owners/timing up front for all assets that you jointly create.
      * 
      * 
      * Hi All! As a PMM, what is you and your team's Northstar metrics?
      * Mainly the adoption rate but to may companies its the conversion rate.
      * Revenue (net new and recurring) and adoption / usage

      * We have a few:
          * Pipeline and bookings
          * Trials and purchases
          * Active users

      * Primary to my team:
          * MQL / Leads
          * Pipeline and Bookings
          * However, am starting to closely monitor some metrics that are a bit closer to home
          * Sales confidence
          * asset/enablement usage
          * GTM efficacy
          * Product Awareness / Fit

      * MQL as 
          * @Scott Heimgartner
          *  said is really important for us too
          * Other than that, we look forward to Early adopter feedbacks

      * Thank you! These are some I am looking to bring in for my team as well. 
          * @Scott Heimgartner
          *  how are you measuring sales confidence, asset usage and GTM efficacy?
          * @Sachin shajan
          *  are you running in-product separate feedbacks or working with CS teams for certain customer feedback?

      * @SJ
      * , measuring sales confidence, asset usage, and GTM efficacy?  We're maturing :wink:.  My team are full stack PMMs, however, I have found that sometimes we might develop a bit of tunnel vision and get short-sided if we try to connect our efforts to just MQLs/Pipeline.  Therefore, have expanded our OKRs to drive behavior to other parts of the funnel.
      * Sales Confidence - Pulse survey 1 per quarter (How confident are you competing against competitor x, y, z (scale of 1 - 5), how impactful is our competitive content and training (scale 1 - 5).... questions like that which gives us a baseline to match up against our OKRs)
      * Asset utilization - Still evolving however we look at downloads and views of sales assets as a marker.  And because we expanded the use case of Klue (beyond competitive enablement to also include GTM/value prop enablement), we're able to get some usage metrics.
      * GTM efficacy - This is rooted in the fact that its the job of the PMMs to align the GTM teams on launches and GTM strategy/execution, therefore we also take a survey pulse of how well the launch team felt aligned and prepared (again scale of 1 - 5).  I'm also exploring product-market fit although many of our solutions are a bit more mature that compete in more mature markets so the jury is still out as to whether that is a good enough measurement for GTM efficacy.  However, as the category of climate & sustainability tech is being defined and shaped by stakeholders as well as government intervention, we're repositioning our solutions to address those needs which will make product-market fit a more viable manner to measure.-->

    * What to measure
      * Ratio of Sale from SQL pipeline: Perhaps one of the best gifts that a marketer, or a salesperson, can receive is an inbound lead that can move quickly through the sales process, ending in a deal. When this happens, especially when it happens frequently, it means that the sales process is working effectively.
    * How to measure
      * No requests for sales meetings: spreadsheet, any crm like Salesforce, so on
      * Number of requests for quote for your product or service: spreadsheet, any crm like Salesforce, so on

  * PQL
    * PQL leads are users who have had a positive experience by seeing significant value in your product due to a free trial. PQL leads are already sold on your product/service and are, therefore, relatively easy to convert into paying customers. They tend to have a higher conversion rate as a result. However, this is primarily true for SAAS-based models where freemium is prevalent.

(quarterly to annually)	Number	Net promoter score or the customer satisfaction score are subjective scores from customers with respect to the quality of service from the company.	Should be monitored. As a subjective opinion, take it with a grain of salt, to be used only in conjunction with hard data.

How do you measure the impact of a product management
====
* Product management metrics
  * Selecting the right product development metrics is essential. Companies have access to a vast array of digital information and the more judicious they are about limiting their focus to the few product KPIs that matter, the more control they have to achieve the right outcomes. Like a vehicle with too many controls on its dashboard, teams with too many metrics sometimes have trouble remembering which button does what. If those metrics aren’t tied to an outcome that matters, such as generating revenue, they might only serve as an unhelpful distraction. Here are a few criteria for selecting metrics:
    * Limit the number of metrics
    * Keep the metrics simple
    * Avoid metrics that would be impractical to collect
    * Prioritize metrics that have a direct revenue impact
  * 10 product development metrics. Strategic product development metrics:
  * Research and development (R&D) as a percentage of sales
  * Total R&D / product headcount
  * New product sales
  * New patent generation 
  * New products released
  * Average product ROI


Core success metrics for product marketing
====
* product marketing metrics
    * positioning/messaging
      * figuring out value propositions on the market, marketing channels for the audiences, and new marketing communication for the audience.
      * Spot upgrades to sales collateral while trying to drive portfolio-wide buyer research, positioning, and messaging.”
      * “Big messaging updates and changes to our website and branding; opening communication with the product team and creating projects that require us to collaborate. “I’d also like to increase engagement, fine-tune positioning and messaging and train the sales team.”
      * “Up-level content so it’s rich and compelling, understand our competitors, enable sales with value-based messaging.”
      * “This has meant rolling up sleeves and delivering on the basics: codifying our target markets, personas, value propositions, and key use cases and quickly delivering competitive battle cards and other sales enablement assets to the field.” 

    * Persona
      * “At this early stage, forming goals around competitive analysis, market research, and customer research, and baselining the client engagement lifecycle model to develop a strategic marketing plan.”
      * “My goals are to launch updated personas by X date; drive adoption of new messaging and positioning/pitch deck; deliver $XM pipeline for a newly launched product in Q1; improve attendee rating of our conference over last year.” 

    * GTM
      * “Gain the trust of stakeholders in our GTM process and assets. Clearly illustrate our total addressable market (TAM) and how we compete in each product-segment pairing. Balance the proportion of our investments in revenue-generating TAM segments and growth segments to diversify our markets, buyers, and products.  “To engage customers so that we better understand them, and increase the value we deliver, remove friction and grow their usage and adoption.” 
      * “Move upmarket, position the product as higher value at a higher price and expand into the enterprise.”
      * “Increase retention and usage, increase revenue and refine our global communication strategy.”
      * “Increased sell-through and a specific revenue goal.”
      * “Grow revenue, establish market leadership (or at least a clear brand position), and get promoted.”
      * “Establish Celigo as a thought-leader in our market, increase ASP, accelerate land and expand the flywheel.” 
      * “Have a measurable impact on sales.”
      * “Direct revenue tie-in, product adoption, and broader marketing/company influence.” 
      * “Ensure each person on the team knows what they own and is set up for success. Build strong internal partnerships so that I can bring them along on my vision.” 
      * “Help Udemy drive revenue (by helping sales and customer success). Strategic narrative and messaging. Beat competition.”
      * “Increase product retention, increase merchants’ involvement and engagement with the product and community. Revise sales enablement structure and simplify sales processes. Unify the user journey and reduce friction.” 
      * “Create and implement new positioning to differentiate us, full localization of all content in our top markets, define TAM, and create a new website.” 
      * “A seat at the table a bit earlier in the roadmap process; full transparency between product and product marketing, improved collaboration between the rest of the marketing function, and continuing to grow trust with sales teams in the field by providing true value.” 
      * “Growth! Maturing and streamlining our go-to-market strategy and rallying sales, channel, marketing, product, and other teams around it. Moving from a product to a portfolio marketing strategy.
      * “Develop a best-in-class marketing function and build a healthy pipeline of deals.” 
      * “Maturing cross-departmental operations related to new product introduction and injecting more experimentation and measurement within the marketing team.” 
  * Go-to-market initiatives 
    * Win rates, Conversion rates, Analyst reports
  * Payback period
      * ------
      * This is a really important metric to track to ensure your upfront costs and marketing efforts are paying your business back further down the line. 
      * For example, if your demand gen costs are still keeping your business profitable, or at the minimum, keeping your numbers in the green when you’re just looking for user growth. 
      * Your payback period is how long it takes to win back your upfront costs of winning a paid user. For a healthy SaaS, this should be 12 months or less. You can calculate your payback period using the following equation: 
      * CAC / ARPA = Payback Period 
      * Psst! Your ARPA = your average revenue per account per month. Some people say this is your annual revenue per account, but we’re keeping it as average revenue per account on a monthly basis, for what we’ve mentioned above.
      * Days in status
      * ------
      * An absolute must for Ian Marck, Head of Growth at EasyMovie, is the days a lead stays on a given status before moving to the next one. In short, days in status—each section is part of a greater metric: marketing cycle length (MCL). Days in status can refer to any stage in the sales funnel; it could be MQL to SQL or directly MQL to customer.
      * “While this indicator is normally considered for RevOps or Sales, I can divide my acquisition cost per day on a given status. CAC is a nice indicator but rather on the end-tail of the typical process. 
      * What I am looking at is to shed some light on how the budget is impacting the pipeline. Not just in plain number of leads, but also in velocity or the duration of a phase. Where exactly in my pipeline are demand gen efforts are contributing?”
      * A good demand gen strategy alongside a sleek sales machine and RevOps strategy should see your days in status either reducing or being at a rate the provides your business value while not losing time. 
      * It’s a delicate balance of efficiency and speed—not rushing someone through a process they’re not ready for.
      * Marketing sourced pipeline
      * ------
      * This metric is also referred to as the ‘close rate’ per channel. Andy Davis, Director of demand gen at Attest, shared his view on this all-important demand gen metric. 
      * “Marketing sourced pipeline and revenue are critical success measures for demand gen. They are what demand or revenue-generating teams are there to do. 
      * Even with a fairly quick SaaS sales cycle, you likely still have a 30-60 day sales cycle. Demo requests on your website are an excellent leading metric to track. This is a very clear measure of creating increased demand in the market. 
      * An increase in demo requests is an increase in the people with sales intent who are actively seeking you out.”
      * With this in mind, keep an eye on where your best demand gen sources are. What are they costing your business? What’s the return of investment for each? If you can identify demand gen avenues that are working well for your SaaS, then consider if it’s worth investing more in that particular channel—be it time, money, or something else. 
      * 
      * Average deal size 
      * ------
      * Within your demand gen strategy, you’re likely to have numerous tactics to build demand among your ICPs. For this reason, a core metric to track for your demand gen progress is the average deal size you’re winning from each tactic. 
      * When you can attribute a channel to the largest deals, rather than simply the most deals, you can start making smarter decisions about where to place your time and money. 
      * For example, you could find a customer from SEO efforts is 4x more likely to sign a larger contract than five customers from PPC. Yet, you spend the same amount of time on each channel—for now. 
      * Measure your average deal size and from which channel, and you’ll make smarter lead generation decisions in the future. 
      * SEO ROI for SaaS
      * Contribution to total revenue
      * ------
      * Once you’ve got the above demand gen KPIs locked down, you can start looking at the bigger picture. How much revenue is your demand gen bringing your SaaS business in comparison to other revenue generation strategies?
      * For example, compare the amount of revenue your demand gen has brought to your upselling or cross-selling strategies to current customers. Are you generating more revenue? Are you generating less? What’s really making a profit for your SaaS, and what are you spending money on because you think you should be?
      * Content performance 
      * ------
      * There’s a high chance you’ll be using plenty of different content types to build and maintain your demand gen strategy. Whether you’re using video, blogs, illustrations, great storytelling, infographics, or something else, there are quantitative ways for you to measure the success of your content depending on how you’re distributing it.
      * For example, social media can tell you a lot about your content is being received with comments, likes, shares, saves, and post or link clicks insights. Various email management tools can also let you know if your subject lines are punchy enough to get an open or your in-email content is earning clicks. 
      * Find SaaS tools that will give your quantitative feedback on the effectiveness of your content and work with the data you have. There’s always room to optimize your demand gen strategy.
      * Brand sentiment 
      * ------
      * Last but certainly not least for demand gen metrics to track is your brand sentiment. If you’re delivering branded content well at the top of funnel, you should start to see your brand sentiment lift over time. 
      * Like with content performance tracking, there are a few SaaS tools out there to empower you to get the feedback you need. 
      * Platforms like Typeform and VideoAsk are great for customer feedback, or you can try a user research platform like Maze to test your brand sentiment against your target demographic. 
      * However, you chose to compose your brand sentiment research; the important thing is that you’re doing it, learning from it, and constantly tweaking your content upfront to build better relationships with future customers.

    * 20- Session Duration
  * Customer Lifetime Value CLTV
  * ------
  * Customer lifetime value, CLTV, sometimes shortened to LTV, is a great demand generation metric to track. It’s referring to the average customer lifetime value, no individual cases. By seeing an increase in your customer lifetime value, you know that your demand generation is going the extra mile. What do we mean here? There’s a difference between generating demand for your SaaS and generating educated demand. 
  * When it comes to customer lifetime value, there’s absolutely no point in generating demand for your business if this demand will not convert—either into sales or referrals. If you’re generating demand but are not seeing an increase in customer lifetime value or some of the other metrics we’ve mentioned above, then your efforts are in vain. 
  * Customer lifetime value is an important reminder that you can’t just be shooting for demand for the sake of hitting vanity metrics. If your demand is not going to stick around, then it’s time to reassess what you’re doing up front. 
  * Customer satisfaction score (CSAT)
    * For your product to drive your company’s growth, you need to ensure your users are satisfied with your product. You might not be able to assign a numerical value to a person’s overall happiness, but when it comes to gauging how much your average customer likes your product, there’s a metric for that—CSAT.
    * Measuring customer satisfaction (CSAT) requires hearing directly from your users, so the feedback is especially valuable during product development. Build analytical feedback into your product with an in-app survey, so users can submit their opinions of your product as they engage with it.
    * Conducting live user interviews is also valuable for in-depth feedback. Keep in mind though, calculating your CSAT only requires users to rate their experience with your product on a short scale, usually between one and five, where 1 equals extremely dissatisfied and 5 equals extremely satisfied.  
    * Like all other product metrics, your CSAT score will vary over time. The longer someone uses a product, the more time they have to either find more value in it or discover its challenges, so be sure to measure CSAT regularly. Present in-app user surveys at regular intervals (once a month is a good frequency) to stay on top of which direction customer satisfaction is trending. Whether your CSAT score increases or drops, remember to collect more in-depth customer feedback to supplement and enrich the data you have. It’s good to know how satisfied customers are with your product, but it’s more important to know why they feel that way.

metrics for a Marketing
====
* Marketing support
  * Campaign performance, Site traffic, MQLs and SQLs
  * Check the google trends on TOFL, MOFL, BOFL vs MQLs and SQLs
  * Marketing Qualified Leads: MQLs 
    * ------
    * A market qualified lead is someone who you deem as very likely to convert into a sale. It is not someone ready to buy there and then, but someone aware of your brand and solution, needs it, and is willing to learn more about it. An MQL is someone that will welcome more marketing/nurturing. 
    * Of course, people don’t turn around and say to you: “Hey, I’m an MQL!” if only things were that easy. This means you’ll need a certain amount of lead intelligence to determine a Marketing Qualified Leads. These factors are informed by closed-loop analytics. This can be anything from: 
      * clicks on key pages on your website (like the sales and product pages) 
      * time spent on site
      * XX amount of site visits within a period 
      * signing up for your newsletter or other low-barrier signup content
      * downloading a whitepaper or guide
      * attending a webinar 
    * All of these actions indicate someone is happy to engage with your business, needs your solution, but for whatever reason needs more marketing material to buy. 
    * Sales Qualified Lead (SQLs) & Sales Accepted Lead (SALs)
    * ------
    * Sales qualified leads (SQLs) and sales accepted leads (SALs) are two essential demand gen metrics that will indicate if your demand gen strategy is performing well or not. 
    * An SQL is someone your sales team has qualified to receive sales material and buy your product. They are often referred to as a ‘hot’ lead and, like an MQL, will need data intelligence (that you decide upon) to determine they’re ready to be sold to or not. 
    * These determining factors come from past sales if you’ve never aligned on this before. A few things to consider are: 
      * frequent visits to the pricing page
      * contacting sales 
      * trialing a freemium version of your product 
      * having items in their cart/basket
      * undergone the checkout process but dropped off 
      * certain keywords mentioned with your chatbot
    * Similar to an SQL is a SAL—a sales accepted lead. The difference between these two things is how hands-on your marketing and sales teams are, who is leading who, and how much technology you can access. 
    * Whereas digital actions can determine an SQL, a SAL refers to the lead being accepted by sales manually. This is typically done at a more qualitative level. For example, a salesperson may have a call with someone and deem them “acceptable” to be sold to, need nurturing (an MQL), or be unqualified—for numerous reasons. 
    * Both of these metrics are fantastic in identifying demand for your product.
    * Cost per Acquisition, CAC
    * ------
    * Your cost per acquisition is a fantastic insight into the success of your demand gen strategy. Although following demand generation best practices doesn’t necessarily mean sales, the number of customers acquired and how much those sales cost you are attributed to your demand gen strategies. 
    * Note: this metric is different from your cost per lead (CPL).  Your cost per lead looks at people that could potentially buy, however, customer acquisition costs looks at those who do buy.
    * For example, if you make ten sales and a profit of $9 per month per sale, but your customers are only staying with you for one month, and you spent $100 per customer on marketing strategies and costs, you’re not working towards a sustainable and profitable business. 
    * By keeping an eye on your cost per acquisition, you keep an eye on how much each customer costs you. Consider what your spend to acquire customers is and their ROI: customer lifetime value (CLTV). 
    * By measuring customer acquisition costs, it’s an indicator of the demand you have—or have not—managed to generate for your SaaS.
    * Activations & Signups
    * ------
    * Two key metrics that come hand-in-hand when measuring demand generation are your activations and your signups. 
    * How many people are signing up for your product? This doesn’t need to be a paid sign-up; it can also be a freemium version of your SaaS that you’re running. At the same time, how many people are activating within your product, meaning, how many people are becoming active users? 
    * Both of these demand gen metrics let you know your SaaS marketing team and lead generation campaign is doing are doing a great job at the top of the funnel, building knowledgeable demand for your SaaS and business. 
  * Product-qualified leads
    * Product-qualified leads (PQLs) are typically activated users. These are users who have completed a key action within your product, had their aha moment, and experienced your product’s value for themselves.
    * To define what a product-qualified lead looks like for your product, you’ll need to identify your product’s activation event and the actions that users take within your product that indicate they are ready to move on to the next stage in their journey. You can do this through a combination of user interviews, session recordings, and A/B tests to identify the user behaviors that correlate with conversion and retention.
    * In the Product-Led Growth Flywheel framework, time to value is associated with the activation stage of the user journey.
