#Ways to measure the true impact of Product Marketing success? 

PMMs are the backbone of any successful marketing campaigns or sales closures. We don't just sit back and let our clients do all work while we reap the rewards—we strategize, define personas that these campaigns will target, create messaging which connects with those consumers on a personal level; then finally execute flawlessly, so there's no room left for error!
A PMM doesn't end up being very useful without first understanding its purpose – helping you reach your goals more effectively than ever before through strategic planning to develop a hypothesis; AB tests the ideas to collect information and prove it was correct. 

Firstly how best to use what resources you've got available; secondly, deciding which tactics will work better than others - but before anything else- knowing whether they're aligned with your goals (and values). The key to success in product marketing is identifying problems and attacking them across functions. This requires a deep understanding of all areas that impact our quarterly goals(OKRs), which we can't hope to achieve unless our PMs hold responsibility for both top-level KPIs like conversions in MQL or SQL(or TOFU/MOFU/BOFU), the stickiness of the product once customers come in as well as their CSAT Score.

ICP (Ideal customer profile) or Personas: The customer profile should be defined thoroughly, and the marketing team needs to understand them well. Research has been conducted on these populations, but we can point out which data relate specifically to our argument/proof of concept.
A good way is by providing examples such as customer testimonials or research data from surveys completed among consumers who buy one particular product line over another so they may feel more familiar with their preferences compared to other brands available within an industry category. Personas are the lifeblood of any marketing or sales organization. They help us understand our customer's needs, wants, and desires so that we can provide them with a solution that will leave their hearts racing in excitement! However good your company might be at understanding people at first glance, though- without proper research done beforehand, there won't be much chance for success when trying to market products toward these demographics later down the line.

Sales enablement is a critical part of any company's success. PMMs play an integral role in making sure that the field on their competition, product positioning, and messaging are up-to-date with what consumers want or need; they also provide equipment for demos so potential customers can see how great your products work! Sales enablement - the key to success for PMMs is providing customers with a seamless experience from the start asking throughout their buying cycle. Multiple sales enablement assets help achieve this, including pitch decks, competitive battle cards, and training docs/videos. These sales enablement assets will ultimately drive the win-loss ratio and improve the conversion rate of the funnel.

PMMs are the brains behind campaigns, shaping and directing them annually. They also educate marketing organizations on what kind of campaign is needed for their industry or market segmentation strategy so that campaigns can appropriately execute it with maximum effectiveness.

The campaigns run by PMMs throughout the year are shaped and directed to educate marketing managers on why they need certain kinds of advertising. The people who drive these initiatives in the market, called "Campaign Runners," should understand how it all fits together so that there's no confusion or disagreement with decisions being made internally as well among other outside agencies/partnerships when working towards a common goal.

Launch planning is an essential part of product marketing. Product marketing is often the quarterback for launches. They help determine how many launches can be accomplished in a year and whether they're organized enough with proper communication between cross-functional teams involved in the launch. Did the launch reach the right target audience? Did the launch successfully achieve the planned user adoption?

Supporting the analyst community is crucial to the success of any company. However, analyst events are a considerable commitment, but they're worth it when you see your team grow in size and expertise! Does the analyst understand the product positioning and consider you a thought leader?

Events: We have supported countless user conferences, tradeshows, and keynotes. It is one way we help our clients connect with their audience so they can share knowledge or demo new products in person!
